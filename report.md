In this lab, I have initialised a repository on GitHub and named it "2690124_SoftWareDesign". <br>
We created the following files: "student-info.txt", "report.md" and "index.html" and pushed the following files into the repository. <br>
 "student-info.txt" contains our student ID and name. <br>
 "report.md" is the description of the lab. <br>
 "index.html" is the web page that displayed "Hello world, I am 2690124". <br>
We created a branch named "feature/student-details". <br>
We committed a change on the "index.html", adding a paragraph to the web page. <br>
