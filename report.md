In this lab, I have initialised a repository on GitHub and named it "2690124_SoftWareDesign".
We created the following files: "student-info.txt", "report.md" and "index.html" and pushed the following files into the repository.
 "student-info.txt" contains our student ID and name
 "report.md" is the description of the lab. 
 "index.html" is the web page that displayed "Hello world, I am 2690124".
We created a branch named "feature/student-details". 
We committed a change on the "index.html", adding a paragraph to the web page.
